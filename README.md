#### Workshop Descriptions:

- **Introduction to R (2 days):** Participants in this workshop will be introduced to R through the lense of the "Tidyverse" as well as learn basics of the R Language for statistical computing.  In particular we will: 1) learn the fundamentals of R including syntax, functions, and packages; 2) spend quality time with the core R data structure, the data frame; 3) learn how to manipulate our data with the `dplyr` and `tidyr` packages; and 4) gain expereince creating data visualizations with `ggplot2`.  Our goal is to set learners up with a foundation for future exploration of R.
- **Intro to tidy models (1 day):** RStudio will be giving an introduction to Tidymodels. Tidymodels is a collection of packages for modeling and machine learning using tidyverse principles. In this session we'll introduce functions from rsample, recipes, parsnip, and yardstick. You'll learn how to split data, fit a model, predict, and compare outcomes with a workflow that easily allows you to change and compare model types.  A training environment with R and RStudio will be provided for all participants. [Example content here](https://github.com/rstudio-education/tidymodels-virtually)
- **Building R Packages, and Other Tools for Reproducible Research (1 day):** This workshop will focus on the fundamentals of collecting and distributing R code as packages, and will cover other tools to support reproducible data science, such as Git and R Markdown.
- **Big Data with R (1 day):** This workshop covers how to analyze large amounts of data in R. We will focus on scaling up our analyses using the same dplyr verbs that we use in our everyday work. We will use dplyr with data.table, databases, and Spark . We will also cover best practices on visualizing, modeling, and sharing against these data sources. Where applicable, we will review recommended connection settings, security best practices, and deployment options.  [Example content here](https://github.com/rstudio-conf-2020/big-data)
- **Spatial Data in R (1 day):** This workshop will focus on the fundamentals of working with spatial data in R – reading and writing spatial data, dealing with map projections, packages for handling both vector and raster data, and visualizing and mapping spatial data in R.  After covering fundamentals, we’ll move through example exercise demonstrating spatial operations such as spatial joins, spatial subsetting, spatial aggregatuibm cropping raster data, and extracting raster data for points and we’ll make use of packages such as sf, sp, raster, rgdal, maptools, and several others.  A basic working knowledge of R will be assumed.
